Plan
Overview:
	The purpose of this project is to create a resume site and will be around 4 pages and shall be entirely responsive and the site should be static. It should be static in order to maintain a simple experience since the information being displayed should be shown quickly and without much input from the user. Though being responsive isnâ€™t extremely important as most potential employers are using computers such as laptops or desktops, it will be nice to have it adjust based on screen size.
Goals:
	The main goal of this project is to display information about myself to share between possible employers that will be able to review the site. In this, they should be able to gather information on my skills, work history, education, and any other related information. The organization of the site will allow easier access to my resume in a more intriguing manner. 
Target Users:
	The target users for this site are possible employers, advisors, and even university admissions offices. The site will display all my resume information in an interesting manner.
Content:
	The site will include a title page with hero image of myself that will provide basic background information on me, a sort of summary. One page will include my background including education and software experience. Another page should include any related positions that I have held. Finally, a contact page listing all my contact and mailing information.
